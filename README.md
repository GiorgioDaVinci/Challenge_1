## Description

The Horiseon website was optimised to meet accessibility standards. This project was done to enable people with accessibility issues access the website.

It was achieved by ensuring the background colours were matching and the website given a concise title, this ensured the website was visually appealing. 

Borders were realigned to ensure that they were the same size and one border was not longer than the other. 

Alternative messages were added to images without one, this enables people who are visually impaired to get a description of the images on the webiste.

Also, the code for the website was further modified to follow the semantic html elements. Some div elements were replaced with headers or footers so as to follow the semantic html elements.
Some code was simplified in the css file because there was a lot repetition, whereas some were deleted if they were of no use. This ensures the code is easily readable by other developers who are interested in my work.
